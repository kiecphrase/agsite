# [Who's Agriculture site is the best?](https://kiecphrase.github.io/agsite/)

### Most countries have some sort of web presence. Also, most countries put a lot of effort into their main pages, since that's where everyone looks, right? But that's not where I'm looking. Any homepage can be great, but who's Ministry / Department of agriculture has the best page?

### This is the goal of this project: To discover which Department / Ministry of agriculture is best.
